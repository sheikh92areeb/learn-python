# Lesson 4 : Our First Program

Today we will write our first ever python program from scratch. It will consist of a bunch of print statements.


## Print() Statement.

print can be used to print something on the console in python

```python
print("---Write Text Here---")

```

Please make sure you attempt this. Might be easy for some of you but please finish each and every task
